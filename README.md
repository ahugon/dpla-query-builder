dpla-query-builder
==================

This GUI sits on top of v1 of the DPLA API (since their dev version keeps changing unpredictably).  It allows users to intuitively ask questions of the DPLA collection, essentially building queries using a drag-and-drop interface.

To see it in action, see http://metalab-library-observatory.herokuapp.com/

The metaLAB (at) Harvard has continued to build on top of this codebase, using it as a foundation for piping data from the DPLA into a variety of different visualizations.  Examples can be found here:
